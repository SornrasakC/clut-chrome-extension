Full description
MRU Tab Switcher is a fork of "CLUT: Cycle Last Used Tabs"
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clut-cycle-last-used-tabs/cobieddmkhhnbeldhncnfcgcaccmehgn


Extra features in this fork (at the time of writing):
- Window-scope toggle -- keep the cycle inside the active Chrome window instead of jumping across every window.
    - Can be changed at extension options page: chrome://extensions/?options=efcjjmicbheekeidonjgopibknedefbp

Everything else matches the original extension.
